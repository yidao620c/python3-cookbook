Python provides a variety of useful built-in data structures, such as lists, sets, and dictionaries.
For the most part, the use of these structures is straightforward. However,
common questions concerning searching, sorting, ordering, and filtering often arise.
Thus, the goal of this chapter is to discuss common data structures and algorithms
involving data. In addition, treatment is given to the various data structures contained
in the collections module.
